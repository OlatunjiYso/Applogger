## About
AppLogger is a simple utility tool that logs errors of all severity to a LOG file.
If the file doesn't exist, it creates one for you!

#### Severity Levels
- INFO
- WARNING
- ERROR
- VERBOSE

#### Usage
```
1. import appLogger, { LogLevels } from './logger';
2. appLogger.log(LogLevels.INFO, "User successfully created with ID:89, email:walex@jupa.com");
```
That is it! ðŸš€
